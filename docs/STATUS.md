# Status

**28 October 2026, morning.** The plan is [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) and its tasks are in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). The
demo runtime stays up and unchanged. This page stays under one page; the board before today is in
[archive/STATUS-2026-10-27.md](archive/STATUS-2026-10-27.md).

## Where each step stands

| Step | State |
| --- | --- |
| 0 Paperwork | Done. The plan is not yet signed (Needs you 1). |
| 1 Code version | `task/int3-pre` is the version we build on; it reaches `staging` after rehearsal 1. |
| 2 Kits | Done. The practice kit is catalogued; the closed kit is sealed (12 files, 4 families, hash only in Git). |
| 3 Stay up, stay smooth | Drop 2 run 3 (S3.11e): all 17 files arrived in 6 minutes, no reload, the API never stopped; 15 read or kept with words. Fixed since: the India file (S5.29), Berlin drawing (S5.30), Halifax keyed by BLPOLY_ID, the batch status read from 2 s to 0.1 s (S5.32), and the runner now times the map and names slow frames (S3.16d, S3.16e). Drop 2 run 4 is running (S3.11f). |
| 4 Understanding | Reading cards exist for every family; drop 2 measures whether each practice file gets a correct one. |
| 5 Drawing | Readers exist for every family in the plan. New since the 27th: Berlin CityGML placed by its stated AdV system (S5.25), a gzip file gives out its member (S5.26), a file with no key field is keyed by each feature's position (S5.27), ZIP and gzip members above 128 MiB are kept through the large receipt (S5.28). |
| 6 Linking | Done: links by key, address and place, shown on the map and in the record panel (S6.1 to S6.4). |
| 7 UI | The batch page layout is fixed at 1440 wide (S7.27, S7.27b). The screenshot set for your acceptance (S7.16) follows drop 2. |
| 8 Rehearsal 1 | Thursday 29 October, on the closed kit, after drop 2's fixes. |

## Known limits

- The Microsoft building file (about 800 MB) is above the streaming ceiling of 500,000
  features; it is kept and explained in words, not drawn.
- A CityJSON file above 8 MiB is kept with words, not drawn. A real 21 MB 3DBAG tile was measured (S5.18b): its
  reading would be 79.5 MB, so admitting it needs a reading that points into the original; that waits until after
  the freeze.

## Where things are

| Thing | State |
| --- | --- |
| Demo runtime `ulpin-demo` | Up, serving `4ffd801a` from `E:/Projects/ulpin-wt/demo`; not changed before step 9 |
| `task/int3-pre` | The newest code, in `E:/Projects/ulpin-wt/int3`, at `9180d490`; pushed; 76 commits (118 with merges) not yet in `staging` |
| `staging` | In `E:/Projects/3d-ulpin`; last pushed `5454ce56` on 27 October; holds the plan, tasks and this page |
| `main` | Never pushed or built on |
| Processor image | `ulpin-geo:git-7580d7661c31`, pinned on `task/int3-pre` (IMG7) |
| Rehearsal runtimes | `ulpin-reh-08` (S3.11f, at `9180d490`, running); `ulpin-reh-07` (S3.11e, at `d7baef36`, stopped, data kept); `ulpin-reh-06` (S3.11c, created at `2b72f962`); `ulpin-reh-05` stopped (first drop 2 try); `ulpin-reh-01` to `04` kept |

## Next

1. Drop 2 run 4 (S3.11f): fix what it finds.
2. The screenshot set (S7.16) for your acceptance.
3. Rehearsal 1 on Thursday 29 (S8.1), then fixes and rehearsal 2 (S9.1, S9.2).
